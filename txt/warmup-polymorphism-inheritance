# Inheritance and Polymorphism Warmup

### Captain America
- What are the 4 pillars of OOP?
    - Encapsulation: each object maintains private state inside a class; grouping of information
    - Abstraction: extension of encapsulation; hiding of information
    - Inheritance: sharing of information
    - Polymorphism: redefining of information
- Define Inheritance in Java
    -takes behavior from parent object
- What is the 'final' keyword?
    - const

### Iron Man
- What are the benefits of an Object Oriented programming language?
    -reusability of the code, if you want similar functionality you can have just one class inherit, security (private/public/protected), design benefits of having already-planned code
- What is a superclass? A subclass?
    - superclass: parent
    - subclass can INHERIT the properties/methods of superclass

### The Hulk
- What is the difference between a Class and an Object?
    - class: blueprint from which you can create an instance
    - object: the instance of the class; what we instantiate
- Does a subclass have access to a superclass method? What about the other way around?
    -


### Black Widow
- What is the difference between a Static and an Instance variable?
    -instance variable only accessed from instance of that class
- How does a subclass override a superclass method?
    -
- How can a subclass use the superclass implementation of a method after it has been overridden?
    -using the super keyword followed by whatever property or method name to refer back to superclass


### Hawkeye
- What is a Constructor?
    -A constructor initializes an object when it is created. It has the same name as its class and is syntactically similar to a method. However, constructors have no explicit return type.
    -Typically, you will use a constructor to give initial values to the instance variables defined by the class, or to perform any other start-up procedures required to create a fully formed object.
    -can be overloaded
    -All classes have constructors, whether you define one or not, because Java automatically provides a default constructor that initializes all member variables to zero. However, once you define your own constructor, the default constructor is no longer used.

- What is meant by Class visibility?


Within the next 30 minutes take time with your group to review these questions and be prepared to talk through the answers.

Only one member needs to present to the class.

Other members may assist in answering questions from the class.
