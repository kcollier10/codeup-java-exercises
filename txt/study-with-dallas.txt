Dallas notes

WATERFALL VS AGILE:

Waterfall - start out and outline everything your going to do, then design it all, then implement, then test, then deliver/maintenance

Agile- continuous/scheduled delivery

Scrum are rules to go by to make you sure you adhere to Agile; use Scrum framework

Gherkins - Acceptance criterion language; used with Cucumber

**Do the SCRUM training series*

Octopus Deploy - used for DevOps CD (continuous deployment)

TeamCity used for CI (continuous integration)

**Scott Hanselman on YouTube**

NoSQL = ‘not only SQL’

KUBERNETES
Node is a worker
Pod is a group of containers (might include ip, storage, other info)
Container is the unit of work (the doer)
One pod could be storage, one could be the shopping cart, one could be for memory

-allows you to set constraints for cpu and memory usage
