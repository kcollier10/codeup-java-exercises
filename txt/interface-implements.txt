Interface Notes

- good for providing common functionality to unrelated classes
- good when we want to implemnt multiple interfaces
- if we're designing small, concise bits of functionality, use interfaces
- if we're designing large functionality, use an abstract class
- contains:
    - abstract methods
    - static constants
