Strings

Strings are not a primitive type, they are a reference type
Strings are immutable in Java; string manipulations will not alter original
String values should not be compared using ‘==‘
Instead, use .equals()

Cannot chain methods on to a boolean
Equals will give a boolean
startsWith will give a boolean
