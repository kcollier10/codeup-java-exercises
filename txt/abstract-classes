Abstract classes have no body:

abstract class Employee {
    public abstract String work();
}

class Accountant extends Employee {
    public String work() {
        return 'crunching numbers';
    }
}

Can serve as a superclass, but cannot be directly instantiated
Abstract classes can define abstract methods, only providing info on name, return type, and parameters

McDonalds is overarching item, locations would be differnt classes
