ARRAYS

Primitive data type: not objects, actual values
Reference data type: the map to get to the value

Arrays are a reference type
Ultimately still a list

Arrays can contain both primitive and reference type values, just not at the same time

Arrays have a fixed length that must be defined
-Data type must also be declared
-are considered an object
-hold 0 or more objects
-[ ] can be read as ‘an array of’

SETTING LENGTH:
double[] prices;
Prices = new double[4];
Will make enough space to have a maximum of 4
Or
Double prices = new double[4];

Final int NUMBER_OF_BEATLES = 4;
BandMember[] theBeatles = new BandMember[NUMBER_OF_BEATLES];

ELEMENTS:

0 indexed
Elements that have not been initialized will be that type’s default
Will get an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds error if you refer to an index that is bigger than the length of the array

DEFAULT VALUES:
Integer number types: 0
Decimal number types: 0.0
Boolean: false
Character: \0 (zero)
Object: null

Null Pointer Exception = trying to find something that doesn’t exist
