JAVA CONCEPT QUESTIONS

What is the difference between compiled and interpreted languages? Static and dynamic? Which is Java, which is JavaScript?
Java is statically typed, JavaScript is dynamically typed

What does a compiler do?
Transmits the code written by a person into machine-readable language

What is a virtual machine?
Doesn’t interfere with actual function of the computer itself

What is the difference between bytecode and source code files?
Source code is computer-readable instructions
Bytecode is source code

Do you need the JDK or the JRE to play minecraft?
JRE

Why would you use an IDE as opposed to a simple text editor when writing Java code?
IDE will automatically compile for you

What is the purpose of the out directory?
Contains project’s output/.class files whenever it’s compiled

Why does Java have multiple number data types? Why use one over the other?
Each one has different number of bytes

Is a string a primitive type in Java?
No, reference type

What is the difference between explicit and implicit casting? What are specific examples?
Implicit (widening)
Explicit (narrow)
In implicit, you’re going from a less specific type to a more specific type. No extra code here, so the cast is done implicitly
In implicit casting, you don’t have to define the type in parentheses
If we want to go from a high precision type to a lower precision type, we need to explicitly put the name of type we are casting inside the parentheses

What are some differences between char and String types?
Char is a primitive type and can hold one character
String is a reference type (aka a full-blown object) so it can take in/hold any number of characters

What happens if you store a number in a variable greater than the data type’s constraints?
It jumps back to the first number
Aka if you raise the byte value over the max of 127 to 128, it will skip 28 and go back to the first available value (-128)
